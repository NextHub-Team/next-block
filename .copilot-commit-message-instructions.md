# 🧭 Getting Started with Conventional Commits

## 📘 Why Conventional Commits
- Provides an easy, consistent structure for commit messages  
- Clearly communicates the purpose of changes  
- Ensures uniformity across teams  
- Enables automated **versioning** and **changelog** generation  
- Makes commit history readable and searchable  
- Allows optional `scope` for more context  
- Supports notation for **breaking changes**  
- Improves team collaboration and review efficiency  
- Helps future troubleshooting with descriptive commits

## 🧩 Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Rules:**
- Limit the subject line to **≤100 characters**  
- Use **imperative verbs** (“add”, “fix”, “update”)  
- Avoid ending the subject with a period  
- Body should explain *why* the change was made  
- Footer can reference issues, e.g., `Closes #123`

## 🎨 Commit Types

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **feat** | Introduces a new feature |
| **fix** | Fixes a bug |
| **docs** | Documentation changes only |
| **style** | Code formatting or non-functional style changes |
| **refactor** | Code restructure without behavior change |
| **perf** | Improves performance |
| **test** | Adds or updates tests |
| **chore** | Maintenance tasks (build scripts, configs, deps) |
| **build** | Build system or dependency changes |
| **ci** | CI/CD or automation changes |
| **revert** | Reverts a previous commit |

## 🧠 Quick Tips
- Focus on **what changed and why**  
- Avoid vague messages like “update code”  
- Keep related changes in a single commit  
- Write messages as if explaining to another developer
